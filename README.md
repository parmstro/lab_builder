# lab_builder
This repository contains all the ansible roles and plays to build my lab. This is NOT A COMPLETE project at this time. Please see below...

This repository is collecting all the individual project that I have started around the "Little Red Box". To see the Little Red Box, please visit my blog at https://blog-parmstro.redhatsa.ca

The lab build includes:
- Red Hat Identity Management with Replicas and "POC" users, groups, HBAC and sudo
- Red Hat Satellite 6.x with all the bells and whistles turned on
- Red Hat Virtualization with IdM integration for hypervisor (Cockpit + ssh) and management 
- Red Hat Ansible Tower and Engine
- Red Hat CloudForms
- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform
- Red Hat Gluster Storage


#UPDATE:
The project has morphed somewhat into a complete rebuild of my lab.
bootstrap of a satellite server is complete. see satellite/build_satellite
