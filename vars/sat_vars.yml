# NOTE: This is a long and complicated file. It represents the complete configuration of 
# a Foreman or Satellite Server, so, ya, long is a good word... lot's of knobs and dials
#
# So...
# _optional sections are well, optional, they only run tasks when defined
# _mandatory sections are, you guessed it, mandatory - they are critical to building
# the foreman or Satellite server **FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT** 
# This is my environment so applies to mine and my goals... see the base README for more.
# Also see my Lab Architecture drawing in the root of the project.
#
# Tasks that fail for anything configured in a section ending in _optional will not stop
# the build of the environment like failures in a _mandatory sections will.
# If you are testing new sections you wish to add and quickly move them between optional
# and mandatory, configure them as optional and use optional_fatal: "true"
#
