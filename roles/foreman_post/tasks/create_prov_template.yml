# Attach to operating system later. During OS Congfig as many to many. Let the OS take from what's available.
# The only fly in the ointment is the partially configured OS we have right now
# this is likely from not including the RHEL 7.6 repository as part of the sync or its a bug... 
# it will add some processing time, but I will try it to see the result.
# Depending, this may necessitate a matching effort like we did with sync plans (kind of Satellite specific as we auto create some things...)
